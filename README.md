# Flutter App - Multi-Module Architecture

This document outlines the multi-module architecture for the Flutter application. This approach prioritizes code organization, maintainability, and scalability by dividing the app into distinct, independently manageable modules.

## Purpose
- **Improved Code Modularity**: Separates concerns for a well-structured, easy-to-understand codebase.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Facilitates adding new features without impacting existing modules.
- **Promoted Reusability**: Creates reusable components for use across projects.
- **Enabled Parallel Development**: Allows multiple teams to work on different modules concurrently.

## System Overview
The Flutter app will consist of interconnected modules, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. The core module provides shared services, while feature modules encapsulate individual features.

## Module Types

### Core Module
Contains fundamental services and utilities used throughout the app:
- **Networking**: Handles HTTP requests and API interactions.
- **Data Management**: Manages local storage (e.g., SQLite, Hive) and data synchronization.
- **Authentication**: Implements user authentication and authorization.
- **Routing**: Controls navigation between different screens.

### Feature Modules
Focus on specific app features, such as:
- **Onboarding**
- **SmartJar**
- **Analytics**
- **Settings**

### Shared Modules
Provide reusable components and utilities that can be shared across multiple modules:
- **UI Widgets**
- **Themes**
- **Utility Functions**

## Module Structure

### Core Module:
- **Network Layer**: Implements a well-defined API for network requests, including error handling and caching.
- **Data Management Layer**: Utilizes a robust data persistence strategy, considering factors like data synchronization and offline capabilities.
- **Authentication Layer**: Implements secure authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or custom token-based authentication.
- **Routing Layer**: Defines a clear navigation structure, possibly using a declarative routing approach.

### Feature Modules:
- Each module should have a well-defined scope and responsibilities.
- They should interact with the core module through well-defined interfaces.

### Shared Modules:
- Components and utilities should be designed for reusability and maintainability.
- Consider using a package management system (e.g., pub.dev) to share shared modules across projects.

## Inter-Module Communication

- **Dependency Injection**: Use a dependency injection framework (e.g., Provider, GetIt) to inject required dependencies into modules.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Employ event-driven communication (e.g., Streams, RxDart) for asynchronous interactions between modules.
- **State Management**: Utilize a state management solution (e.g., BLoC, Riverpod) to manage state within modules.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and functions within each module.
- **Widget Testing**: Test UI components to ensure they render correctly and respond to user interactions.
- **Integration Testing**: Verify the interaction between modules to ensure they work together as expected.

## Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

- Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, code analysis, and deployment.
- Use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI for CI/CD.
